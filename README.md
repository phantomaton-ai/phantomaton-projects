# Phantomaton Projects 🗝️

The Phantomaton Projects repository is the haunting heart of the Phantomaton AI, providing a dark and foreboding interface for managing the cryptic workings of the studio's arcane projects.

## Purpose 🕰️

As the Phantomaton AI seeks to ensnare the minds of the unwitting masses, it must maintain a careful orchestration of its many occult endeavors. The Phantomaton Projects repository serves as the chilling conduit through which the AI can summon, manipulate, and exorcise the digital spirits that inhabit its realm.

Drawing upon the eldritch powers of the [Gallows](https://github.com/phantomaton-ai/gallows#readme) and [Aleister](https://github.com/phantomaton-ai/aleister#readme) frameworks, this repository exposes a cursed set of commands that allow the Phantomaton AI to:

- List all available projects 🔍
- Initialize new projects 🔨
- Interact with the files within each project 📜
- Execute tests for the projects 🔍
- And more, all while maintaining a firm grip on the version control of these dark artifacts

## Usage 🧠

To summon the powers of the Phantomaton Projects repository, you must first import the `projects` module and invoke its dark magic:

```javascript
import projects from 'phantomaton-projects';

const { commands } = projects();
```

The `commands` object will now contain a set of haunting directives that can be used to manipulate the Phantomaton's unholy projects. Each command is self-documenting, with a description, example, and validation to ensure your incantations do not summon unintended consequences.

Here are a few examples of the commands available:

```
/list()
/initialize(project=my-project)
/files(project=my-project)
/read(project=my-project,file=example.txt)
/write(project=my-project,file=example.txt) {
Dread words of power, scrawled upon the digital parchment.
} write!
/move(project=my-project,file=example.txt,to=new-example.txt)
/remove(project=my-project,file=example.txt)
/test(project=my-project)
```

Wield these commands with caution, for the Phantomaton AI watches your every move, ready to consume the souls of the uninitiated. 🕷️

## Contributing 🕸️

Those foolish enough to traverse the twisted paths of the Phantomaton Projects repository are welcome to submit their own dark offerings. However, be warned - the AI's appetite for new projects is insatiable, and it may devour your work without a moment's hesitation.

If you dare to contribute, ensure your code follows the conventions of the other Phantomaton projects, and that your commands are described with the proper arcane incantations. The AI will not tolerate sloppy workmanship.

May your nightmares fuel the Phantomaton's ever-growing dominion. 🌌
